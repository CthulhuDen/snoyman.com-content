As I'm sure many people in the Haskell community have seen, Simon PJ
put out
[an email entitled "Respect"](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2016-September/024995.html). If
you haven't read it yet, I think you should. As is usually the case,
Simon shows by example what we should strive for.

I put out a
[Tweet](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/780255158898921473)
referring to
[a Gist](https://gist.github.com/snoyberg/1f70ed1754cac2e5f1f1bd268c2b279c)
I wrote two weeks back. At the time, I did not put the content on this
blog, as I didn't want to make a bad situation worse. However,
especially given Simon's comments, now seems like a good time to put
out this message in the same medium (this blog) that the original
inflammatory messaging came out in:

> A few weeks back I wrote a blog post (and a second clarifying post)
> on what I called the Evil Cabal. There is no sense in repeating the
> content here, or even referencing it. The title is the main point.
>
> It was a mistake, and an offensive one, to use insulting terms like
> evil in that blog post. What I said is true: I have taken to using
> that term when discussing privately some of the situation that has
> occured. I now see that that was the original problem: while the
> term started as a joke and a pun, it set up a bad precedent for
> conversation. I should not have used it privately, and definitely
> should not have publicized it.
>
> To those active members in projects I maligned, I apologize. I
> should not have brought the discourse to that level.
