Some family and friends have been asking me to write up my thoughts on
the topic of nutrition and exercise. To give proper warning, I want to
say right from the beginning of this that I am _not_ in any way a
qualified expert. I'm a computer programmer who was overweight and
unhealthy for most of my life until my mid-twenties, when I decided to
take control, did a bunch of reading, and have been (mostly) in shape
and far healthier since.

__Impatient?__ Feel free to skip right to [nutrition](#nutrition) or
[exercise](#exercise).

I don't want you to take anything I say as gospel; it's not. Hopefully
this will give you ideas of where to start, topics worth researching,
and short-circuit some of the very self-defeating confusion that I
think most of us have suffered through. I'm not providing sources for
what I'm writing, partly because I want you to read up on topics
yourself, and mostly because I'm too lazy :).

This post is very off the beaten track for me, so I'm unlikely to be
writing more like it. If you _do_ like it and want to see more, or
have some specific questions, please mention so in the comments and
I'll consider making future posts on these topics.

## Philosophy

I've come up with the following philosophical points about health and
fitness, which guide my own decisions a lot:

* Overcomplication is a major enemy. Should you follow a vegan diet, a
  paleo diet, go ketogenic, or respect GI values? Should you run, job,
  sprint, lift weights, do bodyweights? This abundance of seemingly
  contradictory advice is the most demotivating thing out there, and
  prevents so many of us from getting healthy.
* While these complications are real, you can get the vast majority of
  benefits by following many simpler guidelines (I'll talk about those
  later) that almost everyone agrees on. Do the simple stuff first,
  worry about the rocket science later.
* If you read any nutrition study, odds are pretty high there's
  another study that shows the opposite result. Nutrition science is
  greatly lacking in reproduction studies, so take everything you read
  with a grain of salt (and yes, studies on salt are contradictory
  too).
* You'll be best served by following basic guidelines, getting
  comfortable with those, and then experimenting with different
  approaches from that baseline. If you're motivated to, go ahead and
  spend a week or three on a vegan diet, on a keto diet, and anything
  else you believe has a chance of working. Pay attention to how you
  respond to it.

## Who am I?

FIXME: I think you need to have a section that gets more personal- or
even make it 3rd person- talk about the imaginary you... it will allow
people to relate to you and allow them to think that they can do
something about it. Talk about being a computer programmer- sedentary,
evils of snacking etc... most workers today that are reading blogs on
weight loss and general health are office drones shuffling along into
obesity and early death. They dont need to do this. You have moved
away from a genetic predisposition for diabetes, obesity etc... and
they can too.

## Goals

It's useless to talk about "getting healthy" or "getting fit" without
some definition of what that means. Some people are going to have very
specific goals; for example, a power lifter may want to deadlift as
much weight as possible, even if the process shortens his/her lifespan
by 10 years. If you have such specific goals, odds are this post isn't
for you.

I'm going to guess that most people reading this will probably have
the same three goals, though their priorities among the goals will
differ:

* Lose fat
* Gain muscle
*   Improve general health/increase longevity/feel better. This would
    include improvements in things like:

    *   Cardiovascular function
    *   Cholesterol levels

I was specific in my wording on those first two bullets. You may
_think_ you want to lose weight, but you won't be happy if you lose
weight in the form of muscle mass or (worse) organs. Similarly, you
may not think you want to gain muscle, but I'd argue that you do:

* More muscle = more calories burned, making fat loss easier
* More muscle makes moving around in day to day life easier
* You'll look better (both men and women) with more muscle

Caveat: I'm not talking about bodybuilder levels here.

## Nutrition and Exercise

Nutrition is what food you put into your body. Exercise is what
activities you do with your body. Based on the goals above, we need to
acknowledge that you need to address both nutrition and exercise to
address your goals. This is the first big mistake I'll address in this
post.

* If you eat a bunch of junk food, almost no level of exercise you
  perform will burn off the extra fat you're gaining.
* If you don't do any exercise, your body will get weaker, regardless
  of what you're eating.

So this is important: you need to do both. Period. If you're going to
pick one of them to start off with... I guess I'd say start with
nutrition, but it's really a personal call. I'd recommend starting
with whatever you believe you're more likely to stick with.

OK, let's start talking about nutrition. Feel free to
[skip down to the exercise section](#exercise) first if you want.

## Nutrition

For the completely impatient, here are my recommendations on where you
should get started:

1. Stop eating processed foods
2. FIXME

### Nutrients

We need to get two different things from our food:

* Essential nutrients
* Energy

Essential nutrients are things that our body requires to live, and
cannot make itself. Energy is what powers us. Without either of these,
we die. You've probably heard of calories before. A calorie is a unit
of measurement for energy. Each person has different requirements for
both essential nutrients and calories, which we'll get to shortly.

The thing is that these two requirements overlap significantly. For
example, Omega 3 fatty acids are an essential nutrient, but they also
provide energy. Therefore, it's impossible to say something like "I'm
going to get all of my energy from carbohydrates," since you'll be
required to eat protein and fat as well.

Alright, let's break down nutrients:

* __Macronutrients__, aka __macros__, are either protein,
  carbohydrates (carbs), or fat. All three of these provide some level
  of energy (more on that later). As far as the essential aspects of
  these are concerned:

    *   Protein is made up of _amino acids_. There are 21 different
        amino acids, of which 9 are _essential_. Amino acids are used
        by your body for building most of its structure (muscles,
        organs, bones).

    *   There are two essential fatty acids: Omega 3 and
        Omega 6. You've probably heard a lot about Omega 3. That's
        because our modern diets (for reasons I won't get into) have a
        much higher level of Omega 6 relative to Omega 3, which is
        theorized to be a cause of many diseases via
        inflammation. That means you likely don't need to worry about
        getting enough Omega 6, but may want to supplement Omega 3
        (such as with fish oil pills).

        Other than that, you don't need to eat any fats. Your body can
        create its own fat (via *de novo lipogensis*) for fat storage.

    *   There are no essential carbs. Fiber is a form of carbs that
        our bodies don't break down well, and help with
        digestion. Fiber also helps us feel full. But by saying this
        is non-essential, my point is: you can eat a diet without any
        carbs at all and survive. (Whether you should is a different
        issue.)
* __Micronutrients__ are vitamins and minerals. There are many of
  these, and I'm not going to be getting into too many details here,
  because it's complicated, and I'm not all that familiar on the
  details. You can supplement these with multivitamins. But much
  better in my opinion is to eat real foods (as opposed to processed
  foods) that give you a good variety of micronutrients.


### Calories

*Unimportant side note:* One calorie is the amount of energy needed to
raise one gram of water one degree Celsius. When you read calories on
food, it's actually talking about kilo-calories, or Calories (capital
C), or food calories. The point is: there's a thousand "real" calories
in a food calorie. I only mention this because it can be a point of
confusion. We'll in general be talking about food calories, and just
referring to them as calories.

Each of the macronutrients provides a different amount of calories:

* Fat: 9 calories/gram
* Carbs: 4 calories/gram
* Protein: 4 calories/gram

But these numbers don't add up exactly as you'd expect. For example,
protein is harder to convert into usable energy than the other two,
and therefore it takes more energy to perform the breakdown. This is
called the *thermic effect of food*, and means that you'll get less
net energy from 9 grams of protein than from 4 grams of fat or 9 grams
of carbs, even though in theory they should be the same.

This brings us to our first important point: the macronutrients each
follow different metabolic pathways for digestion, and therefore can
have different effects on the body. We'll cover the difference between
carbs and fat in a later section. For now, I want to point out that
protein is a suboptimal energy source. This greatly affects how we
want to consider protein as part of our diet (also in an upcoming
section).

### Total Daily Energy Expenditure

Your body needs energy to operate. The total energy it needs on a
daily basis is the TDEE, or Total Daily Energy Expenditure. If you eat
more energy than this number, the excess will be stored as fat. If you
eat less, the difference will be taken from fat. This is known as
calories-in/calories-out.

You'll see lots of debates online about this point. Here's my personal
take: it's a truism, but misses a lot of the point. Yes, if you eat a
lot more food, you'll put on weight. But the situation is quite a bit
more complicated than this. The amount and type of food you eat
affects hormone levels that influence your energy expenditure and
hunger levels. And while my simplified model talks about adding and
losing fat, we have other body mass (glycogen and muscle) which will
be afected as well.

What's my point in all of this? Yes, you should be aware of your
TDEE. Let it be a general guide (in addition to hunger signals) to how
much you should eat. But realize it's an estimate, and that trying to
change it (such as by eating only 500 calories a day) will not
immediately result in losing the amount of fat you expect. Your body
may slow down its metabolism to compensate, you may cheat more often,
etc.

You can find lots of TDEE calculators online,
[here's one I find with a quick search](https://tdeecalculator.net/). Also,
one pound of body fat contains 3500 calories (7700 per kilogram), so
in theory, you'd need to eat at a calorie deficit of 500 calories per
day for a week to lose one pound of fat.

### Protein Requirements

Since, as we said above, protein isn't a great source for energy, we
primarily want to include protein in our diet for its non-energy
aspects. This involves the "essential" bit about providing amino
acids. However, there's another big benefit that comes from eating
protein: you tend to stay full longer when you eat protein. One
recommendation that I like to follow is to include a protein source in
every meal.

So then the question is: how much protein do you need? You'll see lots
of values thrown around for this. For example, 1 gram of protein per
pound of bodyweight. That means, if you weigh 170 pounds, you'd target
170 grams of protein per day. But numbers really vary all over the
place. Some standards place this as a certain number of grams per
pound of *lean* body weight (meaning, ignoring your body fat). How
much you need also varies with what kind of activity you're doing: if
you're trying to build muscle, you'll usually want to eat more
protein.

I'd recommend doing some research yourself on how much protein you
need to get per day, I'm going to avoid making a recommendation. I
will, instead, try to debunk some myths:

* If you eat only 100% protein all day, you're not going to grow super
  muscles. Eventually,
  [you'll die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_poisoning) from
  something known as rabbit starvation.
* That said, eating a high-protein diet, above the Recommended Daily
  Allowance, isn't going to send you into renal failure. Unless you
  have some preexisting condition, you'll be able to handle a fairly
  high protein level without issue.

One of the biggest downsides with protein is that it tends to be
relatively expensive (compare the cost of a steak vs a loaf of
bread). Also, different protein sources have different absorption
rates in the body. Finally, referring back to the essential amino
acids, not all protein sources are _complete_, especially not vegan
ones. If you're eating animal products, you're probably fine. With
vegan products, do a little more research on what you're eating (hemp
seed and quinoa are both complete proteins).

__Summary__ Get enough protein, and eat it at each meal to help you
stay full longer.

### Carbs vs fat

Alright, once you're done putting protein into your diet, you'll be
filling up the rest of your calories from carbs and fat. This is
probably one of the biggest areas where that issue of complication I
mentioned comes into play. If you want my simple recommendation: start
off by getting adequate protein and avoiding processed foods. In my
opinion, you'll be getting 80% of the way to a great diet with just
those steps.

OK, you want to get into the details of carbs vs fat? I would say
that, first and foremost, a lot of the most sensational claims out
there are simply not true. Fat doesn't clog your arteries. Carbs don't
magically make you fat. Things are far more nuanced. I'm going to give
a list of benefits for each of these macronutrients.

__Benefits of carbs__

* Since they are less calorically dense than fat, you can eat more of
  them and get the same amount of calories
* Carbs are part of what people often consider healthy foods, like
  fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains. (I encourage you to
  especially research whether fruits and grains should be considered
  healthy in general. I'd recommend moderating fruit intake.)
* Carbs tend to be the cheapest macronutrient available
* Many high carb foods are also high fiber foods, which is good for
  digestion and satiety
* Carbs are broken down into glucose in the body, and stored in the
  body as glycogen, which is a faster burning energy source than
  fat. This makes carbs good for explosive activity (like weight
  lifting or sprinting).
* Unlike fats, carbs cannot be stored directly in the body as
  fat. They need to first be converted to fat via a process called *de
  novo lipogensis*, which loses some energy in the process. In other
  words, 500 calories of excess carbs will result in less body fat as
  500 calories of excess fat.
    * That said, if you eat both fat and carbs in your diet, your body
      will prefer to burn the carbs and store the fat, so given a fair
      mix of both macronutrients, this won't matter too much.

__Benefits of fats__

* Fat tends to leave you feeling fuller longer, since digestion of fat
  is slower. This is very likely the primary mechanism by which
  low-carb diets help you lose weight.
* If you almost completely eliminate carbs, your body will enter a
  state called ketosis, where your liver generates *ketone bodies* for
  your brain and other organs to run off of. This can have great fat
  burning results, and can be used for treating some neurological
  conditions (like epilepsy).
* Eating insufficient fat can lead to hormonal imbalances, and the
  so-called "starvation mode." Having a high-fat low-carb diet can
  allow you to eat less total calories without having your apetite
  ramped up or your metabolism turned down.
* If you eat primarily fat, your body gets better at turning fat into
  usable energy. This doesn't just apply to dietary fat, but to your
  body fat too.
* Glycogen (stored carbs) is very limited in capacity in the body. By
  contrast, even extremely lean people have many thousands/tens of
  thousands of calories available in fat. If your body is good at
  burning fat, it can be a big advantage for endurance activities like
  marathon running or cycling.
* Fats taste good. Carbs can taste good too, but that usually depends
  on the presence of sugar. Most people agree today that sugar is a
  pretty dangerous substance for the body and should be avoided.

There are clearly arguments in favor of both macronutrient. I'd argue
that it has been the obvious case throughout human history that we
have eaten diets high in carbs, high in fats, and high in both, and we
can survive well on any of them. I've personally used all kinds of
diets with good results.

There is one thing I've seen claimed that I think has a lot of logic
to it. Some of the most successful diets today seem to be based around
banning either carbs or fat. Perhaps the reason they work is that the
biggest reward foods&mdash;ice cream, potato chips, chocolate,
etc&mdash;are high in both carbs and fat. By allowing yourself large
quantities of food, but naturally avoiding these highly tempting and
easy-to-binge reward foods, it becomes much easier to adhere to a
diet.

__My recommendation__ Unless you have some ethical or religious reason
guiding your eating, try out whatever popular diet plan appeals to
you. Give it a few weeks at least, ideally a few months, and see how
you respond. If you find that you're constantly fighting cravings even
after trying the diet for a few weeks, consider trying something
else. And if you are not losing body fat, either the diet's a bad one
(don't fall for the ice cream diet!) or you're not following it well.

### Glycogen and water weight

I mentioned above that carbs get stored as glycogen. When your body
stores glycogen, it stores some water to go along with it. This is one
of the reasons why low carb diets have such amazing short term
results: when you first become fat adapted, you burn up your glycogen
stores quickly, and flush out that extra water (in your urine) at the
same time. You can lose a few pounds/kilos in a few short days.

Don't fall into this all-too-common trap:

> Wow, I lost 3 pounds in my first week alone! This is great! If I
> just continue like this for the next 2 months, I'll lose 25 pounds
> in no time!

Then, when you of course can't continue peeing out 2.5 pounds of water
per week and you eventually hit a weight loss plateu, you decide your
diet isn't working and give up. In other words:

__Be wary of the scale, it will lie to you!__

### Intermittent fasting

Something popping up much more recently is intermittent fasting, where
you spend a certain number of hours per day not eating. Perhaps the
most common is the 16-8 fast: you fast 16 hours and only eat
for 8. That might sound rough, but when you realize that sleep is part
of this, and the schedule is "fit all of your eating into 11am-7pm or
similar", it's not too bad.

There are some theoretical health benefits of fasting on its own. Our
bodies can swing between catabolic (breaking down) and anabolic
(building up) phases, and there are advantages to both. If we're
constantly stuffing our faces, our body never has to enter catabolism,
which can be detrimental.

But intermittent fasting has a much simpler motivator: it makes it
easier to eat within your TDEE if you don't spend all day eating. And
during the part of the day you're not eating, it's much easier to
control yourself. At least for me, a simple binary on/off switch for
"am I allowed to eat" is easy.

Do you have to do this? Absolutely not. But if you're feeling like
trying something, go for it. If nothing else, convincing yourself that
you're strong enough to go regularly without eating is a good
psychological barrier to overcome.

### Different types of fat

Saturated. Unsaturated. Monounsaturated. Polyunsaturated. Omegas. Trans. What's
up with all of this? Well, it's just chemistry. Fats are chains of
carbons. Each carbon can form four bonds, and hydrogen can form one
bond. So in theory, each carbon can bond to the carbon to its left,
the carbon to its right, and two hydrogens. If that happens, you have
a saturated fat. This is saturated because each carbon has two
hydrogens.

However, sometimes we'll be missing hydrogens. Instead of binding to
two hydrogens, two carbons can form a double bond. Each of those
carbons will bond with one hydrogen and one other neighboring
hydrogen. When such a double bond forms, we have an unsaturated
fat. Because double bonds are more flexible, unsaturated fats melt
(turn liquid) at lower temperatures. That's why saturated fats (like
butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, but unsaturated fats
(like olive oil) are liquid.

If a fat has just one double bond in it, it's monounsaturated. If it
has more than one, it's polyunsaturated. Two of these polyunsaturated
fats are special: omega 3 and omega 6 are differentiated by the
distance between the tail of the carbon chain and the first double
bond.

Trans fats are unsaturated fats which have been chemically altered to
make them solid at higher temperatures. This is done by hydrogenating
them. Because trans fats occur very rarely naturally, it seems that
our bodies are not particularly good at digesting them, with the
result being that they're bad for our health. Basically: avoid trans
fats.

As mentioned above, both omega 3 and omega 6 are essential fatty
acids. We get plenty of omega 6, so you should try to get more omega
3.

Beyond that, what kind of fats should you go for? That's a topic of
much debate. Up until recently, the answer would be to prefer
polyunsaturated vegetable oils. However, newer evidence points to
saturated fat not being the villain it was thought to be, and
vegetable oil in fact being dangerous. Monounsaturated
fats&mdash;especially olive oil&mdash;seem to be pretty well accepted
as being good for us.

Personally, I avoid vegetable oils and don't avoid saturated fats. But
you'll get lots of conflicting advice on this area. I recommend
reading up.

### Different types of carbs

Simple. Complex. Sugar. Glucose. Fructose. Lactose. Starch. What
exactly are carbs? Time for some more chemistry!

*Saccharide* is another term of carbohydrates. The *monosacharides*
and *disacharides* make up what we call the sugars. The most common
monosacharides are:

* Glucose
* Fructose
* Galactose

Disacharides are pairs of monosacharides, such as:

* Sucrose (table sugar) = glucose + fructose
* Lactose (milk sugar) = galactose + fructose
* Maltose = glucose + glucose

Longer chains of sacharides form *polysacharides*, such as starch (as
you'd find in potatos or rice) and cellulose. Cellulose gives plants
their structure and is indigestible (for the most part) to humans;
you've already seen it referred to here as dietary fiber. However,
some gut bacteria can digest fiber and generate molecules we _can_
digest.

When digesting, our body will break down carbohydrates into
monosacharides so they can be absorbed in the large
intenstine. Because this breakdown takes time, the more *complex* the
carbohydrate (meaning the more sacharides are bound together), the
slower the digestion. This will leave you feeling full longer and
avoid a blood sugar spike.

When your blood sugar spikes, your body releases insulin to remove the
toxic levels of sugar from the blood and store it as glycogen and
fat. One working theory is that, when you eat a diet filled with
simple sugars, you bounce between sugar highs and sugar crashes, the
latter leaving you hungry and irritable, and reaching for that next
sugary snack. All this is to say: avoid simple sugars!

One method for measuring how quickly carbs are absorbed is the
_glycemic index_ (GI), where a higher value means the food is more
quickly absorbed. By this standard, you should probably stick to low
GI foods, unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise (such as
some kind of athletic competition or muscle recovery... but that's
complicated and you should do research on it before trying it out).

Of the three monosaccharides, glucose is the one that our body cells
can use directly. Fructose and galactose must be processed first by
the liver. There are some claims that having a high-fructose diet can
put undo strain on the liver, giving one reason why High Fructose Corn
Syrup has such a bad rap. This is also a reason why binge-eating
fruit&mdash;which is high in fructose&mdash;may not be a great idea.

### Salt

I'm only putting in this section because people will ask. The story
with salt is, in my opinion, completely unclear. There are many
contradictory studies. If you have hypertension, general consensus is
to reduce salt. Beyond that, conventional wisdom says reducing salt is
a good thing, but many newer studies show that it has no benefit. And
also, if you're going for a ketogenic diet, make sure to get plenty of
electrolytes, including salt, potassium, and magnesium.

### Summary of Nutrition

Whew, that's a lot of information! Let me try to simplify all of that
down into some practical advice.

* Avoid processed foods. They're made up of the worst combination of
  foods that basically everyone agrees will kill you: processed oils,
  simple sugars and starches, chemicals, and excess salt. Honestly,
  just following this one piece of advice is in my opinion the best
  thing you can do for your health.
* Eat plenty of protein, and try to get it with each meal.
* Don't eat too many calories in the course of a day.
* Balance your carbs and fats based on your calorie needs. Try out
  variations of that balance and see what works for you.
* Get sufficient omega 3s.
* If necessary, supplement vitamins and minerals.

## Exercise

* Resistance training
    * Bodyweight
    * Weight lifting
        * Free weights
        * Machines
    * Bands
    * Compound vs isolation
    * Importance of proper form
* Cardio
    * LISS
    * HITT
* Mobility/flexibility
